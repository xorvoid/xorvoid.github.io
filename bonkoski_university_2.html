<h1>Bonkoski University</h1>
<p>I want to do a couple more retrospectives, in line with the theme of the previous post.</p>
<p>Since September I've been focused on self-studying lots of (mostly) applied mathematics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientific Computing (Heath)</li>
<li>Linear Optimization (Bertsimas)</li>
<li>Convex Optimization (Boyd)</li>
<li>Statistical Decision Theory (Berger)</li>
<li>Statistical Rethinking (McElreath)</li>
<li>Functional Analysis (Kreyszig) [Pure Math]</li>
</ul>
<h2>How it Started</h2>
<p>I started self-studying math in 2016-ish after feeling like I had significant gaps (compared to some colleagues). My background had always been decidedly low-level computer engineering / compilers / operating-systems / machine-code / etc (e.g. see projects listed here...)</p>
<p>I've always had a rather "brutalist" approach to my own education. I want to learn the foundations and internal structure rather than the pretty finish. So, naturally, I started with the material that is terrorizes/hazes many who elect to study undergraduate pure mathematics: Real Analysis.</p>
<p>I went through Terrance Tao's excellent book, which is really a Foundations course that builds all the way to Real Analysis. Somewhere I had read that if you really want to learn math, you should essentially re-create the entire book: all proofs, all details. That fit my brutalist approach, so it begin. I think I hand-wrote that entire book. And 2 months later I had developed chronic back pain from being hunched over in perpetual confusion by some abstract and pedantic $\epsilon-\delta $ proof.</p>
<p>While I don't think I've ever directly used anything I learned from Real Analysis, I'm oddly found of those moments. Perhaps, its in a sisyphisian or stockholm syndrome way of cherishing ones own memories of type 2 or type 3 fun? But, those struggles had made pure math an epsilon less intimidating which is probably worth its weight in gold. More on that later...</p>
<h2>How its Going</h2>
<p>In some sense, this time is arguably both no different and more brutal:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm still doing it all self-study: having pre-curated lectures and an engaged professor really is under-appreciated by most students</li>
<li>I'm still basically writing all the books out (or at least the most technical parts) but now I do it directly in LaTex</li>
<li>I'm studying four-ish texts simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<p>But in another sense, its more mature:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't fret over every detail of every proof as long as I fully understand the big picture</li>
<li>Its no longer important for me to do <strong>every exercise</strong></li>
<li>I'm focused on subjects that have a strong overlap with computing and applications</li>
<li>I lean on open course materials where possible (e.g. Boyd's Stanford Convex Optimization Lectures)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've learned over the years that writing is my key to learning. I can read the book five times and retain nothing. If I write out the arguments/proofs once, I just get it. I had a very similar experience with learning programming languages actually. Until 2022, I had read and followed the Rust project for a while but had written all of maybe 10 lines of code. It wasn't until I started using it to build a large project in 2022 that everything clicked.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Writing is the key and synthesizes understanding. Reading is only a tool to assist the end-goal of writing.</p>
