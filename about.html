<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Anthony Bonkoski</p>
<p>I've been obsessed with computers since first discovering them as an 8 year-old.
And I've been programming them now for &gt;25 years with great thanks to the <a href="https://mymcls.com/">Monroe County Michigan Public Library</a>
that lent me a book on <i>The C Programming Language</i> at age 10 to kick-start this great journey. And great thanks to the
<a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> for helping me know what I don't know. And finally a huge thanks to Kevin Bowers (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKI31DA4k7Y">talk</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh6Yn2Odyr4">talk</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlzWM5GKQT8">talk</a>) for challenging me by example to be the best engineer I can be.</p>
<p>Until the end of 2022, I worked in Quantitative Finance (HFT) building large-scale high-performance distributed systems
to power trading strategy research. I started an R&amp;D Team known as SCALE (<u>S</u>uper <u>C</u>omputer <u>A</u>cceleration and <u>L</u>arge-scale <u>E</u>ngineering) at a firm
called <a href="https://www.jumptrading.com/">Jump Trading LLC</a>. In that role, I built many large systems that I'm very proud of, but sadly, that work is confidential so I cannot speak about it publicly.</p>
<p>Previously, I worked as a Software Architect at a fabulous company called <a href="https://skyspecs.com/">SkySpecs</a> that builds self-flying drones to inspect wind-turbines in the Alternative Energy space. They're still doing awesome work so please do check them out!
<br /></p>
<p>Currently, I'm taking a break from full-time professional work and spending more time enjoying life and writing.
However, I do periodically accept part-time consulting projects. If you have an interesting project, email me and
let's talk!</p>
<p>Some specific sub-interests of mine (updated 2023):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Low-level Programming</b>: C, C++, Rust, Assembly, Computer Architecture.</li>
<li><b>Distributed Systems</b>: Large-scale Parallel I/O Systems for HPC / Supercomputing</li>
<li><b>Lockfree Datastructures</b>: Generally for high-parallelism kernel-bypass messaging</li>
<li><b>Reverse-engineering</b>: Security analysis, old video game re-implementations from raw machine-code, deobfuscation, etc</li>
<li><b>Compilers and Decompilers</b>: Toy compilers such as <a href="sectorc.html">SectorC</a> and more serious decompilers such as <a href="dis86.html">Dis86</a></li>
<li><b>Finite-field arithmetic</b>: GF(2^n) fields with applications to coding theory, data-resiliency, hashing techniches, etc (see also: <a href="galois_fields_for_great_good_00.html">Learn you Galois Fields for Great Good</a>)</li>
<li><b>Real Analysis and Probability Theory</b>: Math as a second language =&gt; Better engineering</li>
<li><b>Long-Distance Running</b>: Marathon+ distances, Zen via physical exertion, challenge thyself</li>
<li><b>Long-Distance Cycling</b>: Feels good to go fast (in the summer)</li>
<li><b>Skiing</b>: Feels good to go fast (in the winter)</li>
<li><b>Rock Climbing</b>: Because I don't live a dangerous enough life already..</li>
</ul>
