<h3>Dime Time</h3>
<p>It all started with a simple road-side chocolate craving at a rest-stop. I had scronged up all the random coins that had been waiting collecting in the car for countless year. I ventured inside prepared to relive that nostalgic experience of vending machine anxiety: will the change get stuck? will the machine randomly reject my selection, will the wire spiral spin enough times or will the snack just hang there, teasing you? Life is grand.</p>
<p>The Peanut M&amp;Ms cost $1.75 and I proceeded to insert: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 quarters. And fortunately the anxiety was not reinforced; the candies were mine. But, I couldn't get the absurdity of 9 quarters out of my head. That's a lot. I don't mean in terms of buying power, just in the physical size. Ye Olde gumball machines took a single 5 cent coin. That makes sense. A single token should get you something. Sadly, despite experiencing decades of inflation, we (in the USA) haven't bothered to update our coins. In fact, many Americans just see them as useless junk: "change".</p>
<p>So what good are they? It got me thinking.</p>
<p>Two days later, I proudly handed a $20 paper bank note across the counter to pay for breakfest and the cashier exclaimed "Argh, we've run out of quarters. I'll have to make chnage in dimes". Excellent. Next time I'm craving a stack, I'll get to slide 17.5 dimes into the machine. One. At. A. Time.</p>
<p>Three days later, I was sorting through laundry and re-discovered these dimes. Upon walking them over to deposit in my desk "Change Mug", I wondered if this Investment in Change Collection even had positive ROI.</p>
<p>And thus was born the "Dime Time" measure, which I belive to be one of the few, and possibly only useful things for dimes in 2023. Many people measure recuring income/expense in units of "dollar/hour" or "dollar/month". Today we will be exploring the measurements of "dimes/min" and "dimes/sec": Dime Time</p>
<p>For annual incomes (assuming 40 hr/wk, 52 wk)</p>

<p>The USA poverty line for individuals is $14,580 or about 1.1 dime/min
The USA 1% income is ~$800k or about 64 dime/min =&gt; ~ 1 dime/sec !</p>
<p>Let's look at large budgets in Dime Time (using 24 hrs / 365 days):</p>

<p>Now let's say you found a fabulous arbitrage opportunity for that $1.75 pack of M&amp;Ms, selling for N dimes. But, the vending machine
only accepts dimes and you have to physically stand there and insert them, each taking one second. So, inserting 17.5 dimes takes
17.5 seconds, plus some extra for the vending action. Let's call it 20 seconds.</p>
<p>We can define our return R as:</p>
<p><code>R = (N - 17.5)/20 dime/sec</code></p>

<tr>
<td>25.0</td>

<p>When is this information useful? Probably never. But it might be a fun way to amusing yourself while inserting 17.5 dimes into
a rest-stop vending machine. Who said spare change wasn't good for something?</p>
<p>And that's all the time I have to opine on the state of the dime</p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>
