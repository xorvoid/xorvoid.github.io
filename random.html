<h1>Random</h1>
<p>I haven't written in a moment. It turns out that summer is more fun not inside. Who knew?
Now that it's decidedly <i>not summer</i>, it's time to start writing again. But what?
"Do something random" said the voices in my head. So here we go...</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://randomwordgenerator.com/">randomwordgenerator.com</a> for the title of this intro section. And since
Generative AI is going to take over the world soon and life will never be the same again under
the new AI overlords, we should enjoy it while it lasts by generating way too many flawed DALL-E images</p>

<h2>What is random?</h2>
<p>Wikipedia, the Clear Authority of Truth in this world of Fake News, states definitively:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plain">In common usage, randomness is the apparent or actual lack of definite pattern or
predictability in information.[1][2] A random sequence of events, symbols or steps often
has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random
events are, by definition, unpredictable, but if the probability distribution is known,
the frequency of different outcomes over repeated events (or &quot;trials&quot;) is predictable
</code></pre>
<p>I'm sure that changed your life. But more importantly...</p>
<h2>Where is random?</h2>
<p>Tbilisi, Georgia</p>
<p>Dhaka, Bangladesh</p>
<p>Tehran, Iran</p>
<p>Maputo, Mozambique</p>

<h2>How is random?</h2>
<p>Implementing random numbers on a computer is easy. Everyone knows this.
You don't even need a fancy modern programming language. It's just:</p>

<h2>Why is random?</h2>
<p>The answer to this is as complicated as the history to protect it. Legend has it that this is the inner
most secret of the Free Masons and there is a lost Book of the Bible as well. At great personal risk,
I'll reveal one passage from that lost book:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plain">The Book of Random 6.23

And the lord sayeth unto the children, thou shalt not ask of the randoms what thou
shalt not ask of thyne selves. For the randoms are as to the tides.
They cometh in and goeth out. And thee shalt not know why.
</code></pre>
<p>This passage hasn't aged well. But this certainly has: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUeybwTMeWo">here</a></p>
<h2>When is random?</h2>
<p>A sub-atomic particle might believe that "when" is:</p>
<pre><code>f(t;c) = c*e^(-c*t)
</code></pre>
<p>But if that particle is a mass-less photon traveling at the speed-of-light, does causality and randomness even exist?</p>
<h2>Failure</h2>
<p>This giant post is a failure because I have no free will and can't be random</p>
