<h1>I'm Too Old for Broken Builds</h1>
<p>I'm too old for broken builds.</p>
<p>I'm also too old for arguments about build tooling that feel like a Religous Holy War.</p>
<p>Use whatever you use, dig whatever you dig, as long as it <strong>actually</strong> works:</p>
<ul>
<li>CMake</li>
<li>Meson</li>
<li>Make (very pedantically crafted)</li>
<li>Bazel</li>
<li>Waf</li>
<li>Scons</li>
<li>Autotools</li>
<li>A bunch of weird scripts</li>
<li>The Emacs Operating System</li>
<li>The latest web3-scale blockchain technology</li>
<li>A magnetized needle and a steady hand</li>
<li>An obscure bespoke thing created by a single 1980s Soviet programmer who was completely isolated during development, understood no English, and didn't believe in documentation where less than 3 humans on the planet still even know it exists, only 1 of which actually knows how it works... if you can actually find her and win her trust as she's remarkably anti-social.</li>
<li>... use your imagination ...</li>
</ul>
<p>When I get inside a build script file, there's only one thing I really want to do: Leave It ASAP and get back to the real task at hand. You can optimize for that if you like.. or not.</p>
<p>Would it be better if C/C++ had a One Single Thing like those cool kids over at Rust and Go?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But, it's too late unless you can invent a time-machine and go back to say 1970? Then again, I can think of better things to do with a time-machine than "fix build systems", so nevermind.</p>
<p>C'est la vie</p>
