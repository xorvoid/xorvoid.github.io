<h1>Cycling the Pacific Coast Highway (while writing a C compiler)</h1>
<p>Well, I had a crazy adventure this year.</p>
<p>I biked the entire Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) from the border with Tiujana, Mexico all the way to Vancouver, Canada. <a href="adventure_compilering.html">And, I wrote an entire C compiler while doing it</a>.</p>
<p>While I've done many smaller bike tours in the past (weeklong, ~500 mile), this was my very first cross-continent self-supported multi-week tour.</p>
<p>Some numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance: 2,000 miles</li>
<li>Vertical Climbing: 90,000 ft (~17 miles)</li>
<li>Time on Bike: 33 days</li>
<li>Overall Dates: 2025-05-25 to 2025-06-29</li>
<li>Average daily mileage: 61 miles</li>
<li>Average daily wind: 5-10 mph headwind</li>
<li>Weight of added gear: ~50 lbs</li>
<li>C compilers created: 1</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a fantastic adventure packed full of unforgetable moments. And it's impossible to document them all. But, here's a small summary.</p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>2025-05-07 to 2025-05-22</strong>: Packing and planning</p>
<p>The idea is born and packing anxiety begins. Like a newbie, I forgot to take the obligatory gear layout picture. But, I did get a pictures with the bike loaded up. This works out to ~50 lbs of added weight. </p>

<img src="adventure_cycling_01.png" width="500px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-05-13</strong>: Test ride around Las Vegas with gear (87 miles)</p>
<p>We did an 86 mile test ride around Vegas...</p>
<p>Damn, the weight makes this 2x as hard:</p>
<p><insert garmin route></p>
<p><strong>2025-05-24</strong>: Ride day 1 (Mexican border =&gt; Carlsbad, CA)</p>
<p>The adventure begins just north of the border wall with Tujuana, Mexico. Look at this excited and naive adventurer who has no idea what awaits!</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_03.jpg" width="500px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-05-25</strong>: Ride day 2 (Carlsbad, CA =&gt; Irvine, CA)</p>
<p>My partner, "Ezzy", is riding the first 2 days with me from the border to Irvine. At a farmers market south of San Clemente, she discovers that carrots are her "cycling super food".</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_04.jpg" width="400px" /></p>
<p>Laguana Beach is a great place to hammock:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_05.jpg" width="400px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-05-26</strong>: Ride day 3 (Irvine, CA =&gt; Malibu, CA)</p>
<p>Los Angelos is a weird place.</p>
<p>This is "Jumping with Jen", where you strap springs to your feet and dance to music:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_06.png" width="600px" /></p>
<p>This is "roller skate dancing" in Venice Beach complete with loud Boom Boxes:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_07.png" width="600px" /></p>
<p>The houses along the ocean on highway 1 up to Malibu were all burned down in the January 2025 wildfires. Miles and miles of this. Wow.</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_08.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-05-27</strong>: Ride day 4 (Malibu, CA =&gt; Santa Barbara, CA)</p>
<p>This morning I learned how aggressive ants can be. They ate through the side of my tent.</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_09.png" width="400px" /></p>
<p>And then they ate 1/3 of a Cliff Bar!</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_10.png" width="400px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-05-28</strong>: Rest day in Santa Barbara, CA</p>
<p>First rest day after 267 miles at a hostel.</p>
<p><strong>2025-05-29</strong>: Ride day 5 (Santa Barbara, CA =&gt; Lompac, CA)</p>
<p>Woke up to a bike rack that was <strong><em>missing my bike</em></strong>!</p>
<p>Security cameras revealed a theif at 2 am that was in and out in ~5 seconds.  </p>
<p>The jerk was kind enough at least to leave my helment.</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_11.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>Luckily, I had brought my gear bags inside the hostel so I only lost the bike.</p>
<p>Begrudgingly, I headed off to REI to purchase a new bike. The trip <strong>will continue</strong>!</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_12.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-05-30</strong>: Ride day 6 (Lompac, CA =&gt; San Luis Obispo, CA)</p>
<p>Pismo Beach was having its annual car weekend, am I the only non-gasoline-power transportation in town? Cool rides!</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_13.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>And amazing cinnamon rolls.</p>
<p>It's a cycling super food also. Just like pizza. It's nutrition. Simple science.</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_14.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>I had dinner in San Luis Obispo and chatted with a Nevada cattle rancher named <a href="https://www.broughranch.com/pages/about-the-brough-family">Wilde Brough</a>.</p>
<p>Wilde was in town celebrating his grand-daughter's college graduation. He told me about guys that ride <strong>horses</strong> across the
United States.</p>
<p>I interpret this as proof that I'm a completely normal and well-adjusted human.</p>
<p><strong>2025-05-31</strong>: Ride day 7 (San Luis Obispo, CA =&gt; Lake Nacimiento, CA)</p>
<p>Hard ride today up to Lake Nacimiento with lots of firsts.</p>
<p>First flat of the trip:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_15.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>First day of thin shoulders and blind corners (there will be many more...):</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_16.png" width="600px" /></p>
<p>First night "washing up" in a lake:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_17.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>First night sleeping in a dried-up lake bed:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_18.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-06-01</strong>: Ride day 8 (Lake Nacimiento, CA =&gt; King City, CA)</p>
<p>Today was a day of no services (cellular, water, nor food). So I packed everything for the day.</p>
<p>About 10 miles outside of King City, another cyclist was heading the opposite way and crossed over
to talk to me. He asked where he could get water. I said there was nothing. I gave him 1/2 a bottle
and implored him to turn back. He did not...</p>
<p>It was also really hilly and really windy. But it was beautiful:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_19.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>First hot-tub of the trip. This is the DREAM. Why didn't I think of this sooner?!</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_20.png" width="400px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-06-02</strong>: Ride day 9 (King City, CA =&gt; Marina, CA)</p>
<p>I really liked the Salinas Valley.</p>
<p>This was a required detour because Highway 1 through Big Sur
seems permenantly "temporarily" closed on account of continual rock slides. It's like mother nature's
way of reminding humanity that our hubris is out of control. Like... why did we build a highway there
to begin with?</p>
<p>Anyways, the valley is beautiful and feels cozy between the two ridges. Cool to see all the argriculture.
I've definitely bought food grown in these fields.</p>
<p>I wanted to read a John Steinbeck novel.</p>
<p>But I was too busy listening to Margaret Atwood.</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_21.png" width="700px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-06-03</strong>: Ride day 10 (Marina, CA =&gt; Aptos Beach, CA)</p>
<p>Rode down to Carmel by the Sea and around the Montery penninsula before riding up to Aptos</p>
<p>Lots of wealthy people live here, anyone want a used G-Wagon? I didn't inquire.</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_24.jpg" width="700px" /></p>
<p>But it is beautiful</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_22.jpg" width="700px" /></p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_23.jpg" width="700px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-06-04</strong>: Ride day 11 (Aptos Beach, CA =&gt; Palo Alto, CA)</p>
<p>Today, I turned away from the coast and crossed the mountains into the Bay Area to visit a friend in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>It was a hard climb, followed by a super fun 4 mile, 30 mph winding descent, screaming "yeehaw cowboy!"</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_25.png" width="400px" /></p>
<p>Surprisingly, despite being a lifelonf computer programmer, I hadn't been to Silicon Valley since ~2013 (&gt;10 years).
After all these years, I still don't understand why people flock here. Seems like an average suburb but with obscenely
overpriced houses. There are quite a lot of interesting places to develop technology on this planet. It's amazing
that this tiny region has convinced people otherwise.</p>
<p>By the way: Mountain View doesn't really have a "mountain view". Or perhaps we just have very different definitions.</p>
<p>Mountain View, CA:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_26.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>An Actual Mountain View (Red Rocks Canyon, NV): </p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_27.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>But I digress, Silicon Valley is okay. Just not for me...</p>
<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p><strong>2025-06-05</strong>: Rest day in Palo Alto, CA</p>
<p>Mostly spent the day walking around the beautiful Stanford campus and reading about its history. I like walking around engineering campuses.
They have a special energy. And they give me nostalgia.</p>
<p>It has this really neat Christian mural, that seems very out of place at such a secular institution. Oh, how the times change...</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_28.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>Caught up with Eric and Jeff over dinner. We dusted off some RAGBRAI stories.</p>
<p><strong>2025-06-06</strong>: Ride day 12 (Palo Alto, CA =&gt; Lagunitas, CA (Samuel Taylor State Park))</p>
<p>The highlight of today was definitely crossing the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a lot windier than I expected.</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_29.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>Stayed the night at Samuel Taylor State Park and met two Welsh bikepackers: Chris &amp; Emily. They were biking from
Crescent City to San Francisco because they just happened to be in the States for a wedding. Chris was riding with
probably 75 lbs on his bike and he'd just shrug when you mentioned it. Emily was like "he's so strong it doesn't
both him" and "he just casually does Iron Mans".</p>
<p>Again, more evidence that I'm exceedingly normal.</p>
<p><strong>2025-06-07</strong>: Ride day 13 (Lagunitas, CA =&gt; Bodega Bay, CA)</p>
<p>This was a hard day. Wind. Hills. Cloudy and cold.</p>
<p>But I saw a really cool car!</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_30.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p><strong>2025-06-08</strong>: Ride day 14 (Bodega Bay, CA =&gt; Gulala, CA)</p>
<p>Another hard day. Headwinds and Hills. Hills and Headwinds.</p>
<p>Other cyclists ride by and yell across the road "You're going the wrong way!". </p>
<p>There's a reason this route is normally cycled North =&gt; South.</p>
<p>I decide "Going the Wrong Way" is what I would have to called my autobiography. It's the only
common thread in my life choices.</p>
<p>Anyways, can you really be that grumpy when it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_31.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>I'm exhausted and I stop to relax at Stewarts Point Store (excellent shop!)
The other cyclists there tell me about Sea Ranch being this old hippy communue.</p>
<p>An hour later, I discover the Sea Ranch Chapel, which is incredible:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_32.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>And inside:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_33.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>And more:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_34.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>What a thing of beauty!</p>
<p>Such a great day needs a fabulous dinner. Enter "The Shack" in Gualala. 😋</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_35.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>A brutal 3500ft ascent over 50 miles today into the wind, but it was so rewarding!</p>
<p>Worth it.</p>
<p><strong>2025-06-09</strong>: Ride day 15 (Gualala, CA =&gt; Fort Bragg, CA)</p>
<p>Another beautiful day along the amazing coastline. It's brutal up-down up-down, but you see scenes like
this every 5-10 miles that make you forget that you can't feel your legs:</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_36.png" width="600px" /></p>
<p>I was dragging hard this morning. It was cold. I was beat up from the hills on the previous day.</p>
<p>I stopped at the Arena Market &amp; Cafe and bumped into a guy named Aaron. He said he rode the same route
from Vancouver down to Costa Rica 20 years ago.  He was in area leading bike tours in Wine Country. He was also into
cross-country motorcycle touring in Columbia.</p>
<p>That was fun. I wished him well, and set off. No matter how much you enjoy the company, you never see these "one-time friends" again. Right?</p>
<p>Later in the day, I stopped off at Patterson's Pub in Mendocino (Fantastic, no-nonsense pub!)</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_37.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>While I'm enjoying dinner, I look across and see... Aaron. What are the odds?</p>
<p>He's looking a lot less tired than me though...</p>
<p><strong>2025-06-10</strong>: Ride day 16 (Fort Bragg, CA =&gt; Leggett, CA (Redwoods River Resort))</p>
<p>Today was the hardest climbing day of the entire trip. An ascent from the coastline into The Redwoods.
It was a 4800ft ascent over 52 miles, including one "warm-up" climb of 1000ft that you immediately descent back to
sea level before climbing another 2000ft.</p>
<p><img src="adventure_cycling_38.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
<p>Picture of a "not-broken" man...</p>

<h2>Events</h2>
<p>Some events:</p>
<ul>
<li>I rode the first two days from Tijuana to Irvine, CA with my partner Alexandra. It was her first ever multiday tour (for 113 miles)</li>
<li>Visited my friend Kosta in Irvine</li>
<li>My bike got stolen from a hostel in Santa Barbara and I had to buy a new one at REI</li>
<li>Slept in the dried up lake bed of Lake Nacimento</li>
<li>I really liked: San Luis Obispo, Lake Nacimento, and the Salinas Valley</li>
<li>Detoured from the coast to visit my friends Eric and Jeff in Palo Alto</li>
<li>Crossed the Golden Gate Bridge, the trees are fantastic up here!</li>
<li>Slept at Samuel Taylor State Park and met two Welsh bikepackers: Chris &amp; Emily</li>
<li>Met Aaron Frank in a random cafe. He said he rode down the PCH to Coasta Rica 20 years ago. He recruited me to join motorcyle bike trip down in Columbia.</li>
<li>Coastline north of San Fran was some of the hilliest and windiest of the entire trip. But, it was also some of the most beautiful and memorable.</li>
<li>Climbed 4800ft in 52 miles with no services (packed extra water) to get up into the Redwoods</li>
<li>Rode Avenue of the Giants</li>
<li>Everyone in Humboldt county keeps telling me how amazing their weed is and how it cures everything... Cool.</li>
<li>Ferndale, CA is a cool old school victorian-style farming town. I even joined the morning gentleman's gossip club at the general store.</li>
<li>Terifyingly dangerous section of hwy 101 between Klamath and Crescent City: (1) climbing, (2) no shoulder, (3) blind corners, and (4) 50 mph traffic</li>
<li>Met father &amp; son bikepackers from Ireland</li>
<li>Met <a href="https://www.alanaconner.com/">Alana Conner</a> finishing her world-record ride around the world (just north of Crescent City).</li>
<li>Finally finished California. You don't understand how massive California is until you ride a bicycle across it (X days).</li>
<li>Took a ferry across the Columbia River from Oregon to Washington</li>
<li>Met a couple from Ohio on the side of the road having a "joint break". They were riding the same route in the opposite direction. We compared notes on
  how we "stayed alive" on roads with aggressive and entitled drivers.</li>
<li>Wore through an entire back tire and started getting flats (~1300 miles on it).</li>
<li>Stayed with Warm Showers host Beth and Pete in Olympia, WA. They rode all around the world in the 1990s. Pete replaced my back-tired and re-trued the wheel. Good as new!</li>
<li>Rode up Chuckanut to Bellingham. Its beautiful but the locals are over-obsessed with its beatuty. Or I'm spoiled by the entire Pacific Coast.</li>
<li>Crossed the border on my bike into British Columbia. It went much more smoothly than with a vehicle (crossed the border at the same location 1 year prior with a camper van).</li>
<li>Finished ride into Vancouver for a photo on the beach and a celebratory steak dinner 😋</li>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
<p>Since this ride, I've went off to do RAGBRAI again.</p>
